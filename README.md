## Usage

To use the scripts for data augmentation, navigate to the `augmentedDataScripts` folder and run the desired script with the appropriate parameters. Similarly, processing specific training data can be done in the `customDataScripts` folder.

Training and evaluation of models can be performed in the respective model folders (`Mask-RCNN`, `U-Net`, `YOLOv8`). Each folder contains detailed instructions on how to run the scripts and set up the environment.
